# Interactive ETL using Flink SQL

[Flink SQL](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/dev/table/overview/) is a powerful tool for data exploration, manipulation and inter-connection.
It allows you to access the power of Flink's distributed stream processing abilities with a familiar interface. 
In this tutorial we go over a simple introduction to using Flink SQL to read from a Kafka topic, perform basic queries, transform and clean data and then load that back into Kafka.

For instructions on running this tutorial you can either refer to the `docs/Interactive-ETL/index.md` file directly or use the [version]() on the [StreamsHub site](https://tomncooper.github.io/streamshub-site/).
